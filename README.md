Web Scraping(web data extraction) â€“ One can choose any website to do scraping like me. I had chosen Crypto Coin Provider Company (Coin Switch Kuber [CSK]) and used python and its library to do data harvesting.

Why have I made this?

As like many other crypto coin provider players in the market CSK application does not providing any feature of alert to let us determine when the price goes down or up which leads me to make this ðŸ˜Š To Save $Money$.

**Objective:**

  â€¢	To Send alert @every 15 sec by means of sound (if any speaker is attached to on running script device for me, initially it was my laptop and finally get it incorporate with raspberry pi_4(SBC) with speaker which work as my DIY Server + Smart Speaker for different- different application) and email.

  â€¢	It offers you a .csv where you can name coin fallowed by price (at which you want alert to get invoke).

**Setting:**
1)	For sale keep it like as:
